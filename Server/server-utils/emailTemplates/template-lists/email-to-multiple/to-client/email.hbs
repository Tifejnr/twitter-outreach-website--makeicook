        <p>
          Hi
          {{customerName}}, hope you're finding our WFR toolkit useful in
          crafting personalized proposals!
        </p>

        <p>
          We've just rolled out a few enhancements to make your work even more
          efficient, especially when dealing with multiple client names.
        </p>

        <p>Here's how the new functionality works:</p>

        <h2>What's New for multiple client names?</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Number of times each name was mentioned:</b>
          You'll now see the number of times each client name was mentioned in
          the feedback history.
        </p>

        <p>
          This number is placed immediately after the client name e.g
          <b>"James -6".</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          This means the name
          <b>"James"</b>
          was mentioned
          <b>6 times</b>
          in the feedback history.
        </p>

        <p>
          This
          <b>new data point</b>
          will help you craft the most effective greeting every time.
        </p>

        <p>Here's how to use it:</p>

        <article>
          <h2>Scenario 1: Multiple names, same number of times they were
            mentioned</h2>

          <p>
            If all the names retrieved names were mentioned the same number of
            times in feedback, like in the picture below where
            <b>Nitish, Ashani, and Deep </b>
            were all mentioned
            <b>twice(2)</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.ibb.co/4pQSsZQ/no-of-occurences-2-across-all-callout.png"
              alt="same number of times it was mentioneds"
            />
          </p>

          <p>This means they're likely a team of people running the account</p>

          <p>In such case, <b>use "Hi"</b> for personalization</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2>Scenario 2: One Name Dominates</h2>

          <p>
            If the number of times the first name was mentioned in the feedback
            totally dominates the other, like in the picture below where the
            name<b>Marc </b>
            totally dominates<b>Nelson</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.ibb.co/0fwhQQH/no-of-occurence12to1-callout.png"
              alt="dominating no of ocuurence"
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            Number of times<b>Marc</b>
            was mentioned -
            <b>12</b>
            , totally dominates number of times
            <b>Nelson</b>
            was mentioned -
            <b>1</b>.
          </p>

          <p>This means there's a 95% chance <b>"Marc"</b> runs the account.</p>

          <p>
            In this scenario,
            <b>use the dominating name "Marc"</b>
            for personalization
          </p>

          confidently address your clients and make your cover letters more
          personalized and effective.

          <h2>Important Update: Changes Starting Wednesday, October 16th</h2>

          <p>
            <b>From Wednesday, October 16th,</b>
            some of our features will move to
            <b>paid plans,</b>
            and you'll need to purchase credits to access them.
          </p>

          <p>All other features will remain free, but here are the features that
            will require credits:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: disc;">
            <li>
              <p><b>Auto-fetching of client names</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Summary of what it's like working with a client</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Text templates for quick copy</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Viewing "About client" details</b></p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How Credits Work:</h2>

          <p>
            <b>Credits</b>
            are only deducted when you
            <b>access</b>
            the
            <b> proposal submission page.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            That means you'll only be
            <b>charged</b>
            when you're closest to submitting a proposal and most
            productive—taking that final step to land a job on Upwork.
          </p>

          <p>
            And considering you spend about
            <b>₦2500</b>
            when you use
            <b>10 connects</b>
            to apply to a job.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our credits will be super affordable for
            <b>any regular Upwork freelancer!</b>
            It's just about
            <b>₦12</b>
            per credit.
          </p>

          <p>So, you spend about
            <b>₦12</b>
            for each time you access the proposal submission page.</p>
